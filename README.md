# NgrxApp

This project created as a prototype for how to add NGRX Store and Effects to the [Coding Tool App](https://github.com/dneimke/coding-tool).

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the use of NGRX Store+Effects to:

* Maintain state
* Provide a decoupled environment for interacting with external services
* Create testable functions
